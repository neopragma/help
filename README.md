## apport

### apport-disable

Edit /etc/default/apport

Change enabled=1 to enabled=0

## apt

### Encountered a section with no package header

```shell
sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/* -vf
sudo apt update
```

### Package list corrupted

```shell
E: Problem with MergeList /var/lib/apt/lists/[foo]
E: The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.
```

This means the local package list has been corrupted.

#### Solution

```shell
sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/* -vf
sudo apt-get update
```

#### Alternate solution

```shell
sudo mv /var/lib/apt/lists /var/lib/apt/lists-old
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/apt/lists/partial
sudo apt-get update
```

#### Alternate solution

```shell
sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get update
```

#### References

* http://askubuntu.com/questions/30072/how-do-i-fix-a-problem-with-mergelist-or-status-file-could-not-be-parsed-err

## dpkg

### Status database area locked

```shell
dpkg: status database area is locked by another process while trying to install
```

#### Solution

```shell
sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock
sudo dpkg --configure -a
```

## diff

### diff zipped files

Compare the entry names of two zipped files without decompressing them. 

```shell
diff -y <(unzip -l foo.zip) <(unzip -l bar.zip) --suppress-common-lines
```

Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35581274/diff-files-inside-of-zip-without-extracting-it

## git

### change default branch to main 

```shell
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

### hprof file prevents push 

Files named java_pid99999.hprof are due to issues with heap memory being exceeded. If this happens in your project, you won't be able to push to github. Use this command to clean up the local history (substituting the real filename):

```shell 
git filter-branch -f --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch java_pid26029.hprof' 
``` 

Add this to .gitignore and commit it: 

```shell 
*.hprof 
``` 

### rename master branch to main 

```shell
git branch -m master main
```

### stop tracking files

Symptom: ```git status``` shows files you don't want to track.

Solution: Update ```.gitignore``` with filenames to ignore and then:

```shell
git rm -r --cached .
git add .
git commit -m "Cleaned up cached untracked files"
```

## github

### list your repositories

List the names of your repositories in alphabetical order.

```shell
curl "https://api.github.com/users/$GIT_USER/repos?access_token=$GIT_ACCESS_TOKEN&per_page=1000&type=all" | grep '"name":' | sort
```

### personal access token 

After generating a personal access token on Github, for Ubuntu you must enter this:

```shell
git config --global credential.helper store
```

On the next push, it will prompt for a password. Enter the personal access token instead of your password.

## gnome

### Disable overlay scrollbars

#### Problem

Those pesky overlay scrollbars that are enabled by default in Ubuntu prevent you from grabbing the side of a window to resize it. Seems like you should be able to set this in Settings -> Appearance -> Behavior, but you can't.

#### Solution

```shell
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface ubuntu-overlay-scrollbars false
```

### Disable screen timeout

#### Problem 

Screen times out and locks during presentations, demonstrations, mobbing sessions, etc.

#### Solution 

```shell 
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 0
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-enabled false
```

### Gnomekeyring for github

#### Problem

How to store the Github Personal Access Token locally on a Linux instance using Gnome Keyring

#### Solution

Install Gnome Keyring dev package

```shell
sudo apt install libgnome-keyring-dev
```

Build credentials helper

```shell
cd /usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/gnome-keyring
sudo make
```

Configure local Git to used the credentials helper

```shell
git config --global credential.helper /usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/gnome-keyring/git-credential-gnome-keyring
```

On first use, it will prompt for a password for Gnome Keyring. Don't lose track of it!


## Gradle

### Recompile with Xlint 

When working with Java and Gradle, sometimes Gradle issues a warning and suggests recompiling with an -Xlint option, but it does not explain how to do this. You have to add a specification to the build.gradle file as follows.

```shell
tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {
    options.compilerArgs << '-Xlint:unchecked'
    options.deprecation = true
}
```

### Update Gradle from command line 

```shell
./gradlew wrapperâ€Š--gradle-version 4.10.2
```

## OSX

### Add divider to Dock

```shell
defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{"tile-type"="spacer-tile";}'
killall Dock
```

### Disable writing .DS_Store files on network volumes

```shell
defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true
```

### File is in use

Creator and type attributes are modified by Finder during a file copy operation. To reset:

```shell
SetFile -c "" -t "" path/to/file
```

If the SetFile command is not installed, do this:

```shell
xcode-select --install
```

### Hidden files

Apple is very serious about keeping hidden files hidden. OSX is far less user-friendly in this regard than any other \*nix system. Do this:

```shell
defaults write -g AppleShowAllFiles -bool true
```

and then re-launch any applications you would like to show hidden files in the Open dialog.

### HP printer drivers for OSX

Go to http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers

Enter the printer model name/number.

Choose 'Apple OS X' as the operating system and select the version number.

It will take you to a download page. The file you download will be a .zip archive containing an installer.

### NTFS filesystem readonly

OS X mounts external NTFS drive as read-only. 

#### Solution

There is no longer a free workaround for this problem. You have to purchase a commercial product to get read/write support for NTFS. Here are two: 

- Paragon: https://www.paragon-software.com/home/ntfs-mac/ 
- Tuxera: https://www.tuxera.com/products/tuxera-ntfs-for-mac/

_The following instructions are obsolete_

Connect the NTFS drive to the Mac. Open Terminal and find the UUID of the drive:

```shell
diskutil info /Volumes/DRIVENAME | grep UUID
```

Add a line to ```/etc/fstab``` to define the drive as read-write:

```shell
sudo echo "UUID=ENTER_UUID_HERE none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse" >> /etc/fstab
```

An icon for the drive will not appear on the Desktop automatically. You can open a Finder window like this:

```shell
open /Volumes
```

You can define a symlink for a Desktop icon like this:

```Shell
sudo ln -s /Volumes/DRIVENAME ~/Desktop/DRIVENAME
```

### Make an app out of a shell script

1. Write the shell script.
2. In Automator, choose ```run shell script``` and write a one-liner to execute the shell script.
3. Choose ```File``` -> ```Convert to...```, then choose ```Application```.
4. Find a suitable icon and make an ```.icns``` file with it.
5. Right-click on the app file and choose ```Get Info```.
6. Paste the icon over the small icon image located in the upper left-hand corner of the ```Info``` dialog.

### Remove .DS_Store files recursively

```shell
find . -name â€˜*.DS_Storeâ€™ -type f -delete
```

### Remove all .DS_Store files system-wide

```shell
sudo find / -name ".DS_Store" -depth -exec rm {} \;
```

### Replace strings in files recursively

```shell
export LC_CTYPE=C
export LANG=C
find . *.html -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i "" 's/Software Craftsperson/Solution Developer/g'
```

## rvm

### rvm install gets permission denied errors

This happens on Ubuntu using apt. Usually logging out and back in again clears it up.

If that doesn't work, run ```sudo apt update``` and look for any errors (even if unrelated to rvm). Remove any offending entries from ```/etc/apt/sources.list``` and files under ```/etc/apt/sources.list.d```.


## Ubuntu

### Application menu display problem

For some applications, menus don't show up on Ubuntu (I think 13.04 onward) and the application window appears to be shoved up into the top of the screen. To fix this, set environment variable ```UBUNTU_MENUPROXY``` to 0 or to nothing. You can do it on the command line or in a ```.desktop``` file.

```shell
UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 appname
```

### Boot to command line

Set up Ubuntu 15.x and later to boot to a command line by default, edit ```/etc/default/grub```

comment the line
```shell
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
```

Add lines:

```shell 
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="text"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="text"
```

Save the file and run the following commands:

```shell
sudo update-grub
sudo systemctl enable multi-user.target --force
sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target
sudo reboot
```

When you want the graphical interface:

```shell
sudo service lightdm start
```

It will default to the screen resolution you last saved. To see what display resolutions are available on the connected display device:

```shell
xrandr
```

To set the display resolution appropriately for the connected display device:

```shell
xrandr --output `xrandr | grep " connected"|cut -f1 -d" "` --mode 1920x1080
```

### Deactivate suspend 

"Turn off" suspend, hibernate, and hybrid suspend in Linux.

```shell
sudo systemctl mask \
    sleep.target \
    suspend.target \
    hibernate.target \
    hybrid-sleep.target

sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind.service
```

Check status: 

```shell 
systemctl status sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target
```    

Reactive these features: 

```shell 
sudo systemctl unmask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target
```

What does this actually do? 

The mask command does this: 

```shell 
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/sleep.target â†’ /dev/null.
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/suspend.target â†’ /dev/null.
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/hibernate.target â†’ /dev/null.
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/hybrid-sleep.target â†’ /dev/null.
```

The unmask command does this: 

```shell 
Removed /etc/systemd/system/sleep.target.
Removed /etc/systemd/system/suspend.target.
Removed /etc/systemd/system/hibernate.target.
Removed /etc/systemd/system/hybrid-sleep.target.
```


### Determine the Ubuntu version

```shell
lsb_release -a
```

### Determine the types of filesystems

```shell
df -T
```

### Enable ssh connection as root

Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

```shell
PermitRootLogin yes
```

Restart sshd

```shell
/etc/init.d/ssh restart
```

Set root password if there isn't one

```shell
sudo passwd root
```

### HP printer drivers

Find out what version of HPLIP is installed:

```shell
dpkg -l hplip
```

Install HPLIP

```shell
sudo apt-get install hplip
```

### Format USB stick NTFS for Ubuntu

Insert the USB stick. If it's a new one that's preformatted FAT32, Ubuntu will add it to the device list but not mount it.

Run ```dmesg``` or ```df -h``` and find the device name. It will be something like ```sdb1```.

Now run

```shell
sudo mkfs.ntfs /dev/sdb1
```

Now the USB stick will be accessible with ```ntfs-3g```.


### NTFS filesystem is read-only Ubuntu

```
sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g
```

### PostgreSQL install on Ubuntu

The basic installation instructions here are useful: https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/ubuntu-postgresql-installation/

Then do this:

```shell
sudo cp /etc/postgresql/*/main/postgresql.conf ./postgresql.conf.orig
sudo cp /etc/postgresql/*/main/pg_hba.conf ./pg_hba.conf.orig
sudo cp ./pg_hba.conf /etc/postgresql/*/main
sudo sed -i "/#listen_addresses/c\listen_addresses = \'*\'" /etc/postgresql/*/main/postgresql.conf
```

### ULauncher install on Ubuntu 

```shell 
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:agornostal/ulauncher 
sudo apt install ulauncher 
```

### Wired networking disabled on boot 

Starting with Ubuntu 20.04, I noticed wired networking was off after startup. This may be the default for some versions of Ubuntu. If you want wired networking on by default on boot, edit file ```/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf``` with sudo. Change the line ```managed=false``` to ```managed=true```. Then you can restart or run the following command: 

```shell 
sudo service network-manager restart 
``` 

## UNIX/Linux 

### Replace string recursively ignore hidden files 

The -i argument to sed must have the name of the backup suffix for OSX. It's optional for Linux but must come after the -i with no intervening space.

```
find . \( ! -path '*/.*' \) -type f -exec sed -i~ "s/alpha/delta/g" '{}' ';'
```


## VisualStudio

### Nuget executable not found

VisualStudio can't find a nuget.exe when it tries to build a project.

Solution: Download a nuget.exe from https://dist.nuget.org/index.html

### NUnit tests not discovered

When you run tests, it says there are no NUnit tests to run.

Solution: 
* In VisualStudio, go to Tools => Extensions and Updates
* Search for "nunit"
* Look for the NUnit 3 Test Adapter and install it


## VMWare Fusion

### Fusion 10 does not start correctly on OSX 10.12

VMWare Fusion 10 starts in a corrupted state when opened via clicking its icon. Workaround is to start it from a command line:

```
/Applications/VMware\ Fusion.app/Contents/MacOS/VMware\ Fusion
```


## Windows

### Equivalent of kill command

Find out what command options are available:

```shell
taskkill /?
```

Kill a process by name:

```shell
taskkill /im myprocess.exe /f
```

Kill a process by PID:

```shell
taskkill /pid 1234 /f
```

### Equivalent of touch command

```shell
type nul > filename & copy filename +,,
```

### HP printer drivers for Windows

Go to http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers

Enter the printer model name/number.

Choose 'Microsoft Windows' as the operating system and select the version number.

It will take you to a download page. The file you download will be an .exe you can run to install the driver.

### Command line elevated

Open a standard command-line window

Enter

```shell
powershell
```

At the PS prompt, enter

```shell
Start-Process cmd -Verb RunAs
```

A second command-line window opens running with Administrator privileges.

## Wordpress

### Delete all unapproved comments

1. Go to phpmyadmin in your control panel (based on your hosting plan)

2. Click your Word Press database link

3. Click on the comments table (You can click browse to view all the approved and unapproved comments)

4. Click the mySQL tab. This will open up a query box. Delete the default query and type in:

DELETE FROM wp_comments WHERE comment_approved = 0

5. Click go, this will delete all the unapproved comments

## X-windows

### Wrong screen resolution

When running as a guest OS in a virtual machine (VM), the OS does not recognize the screen resolutions available on the actual hardware. The xorg video driver normally discovers the optimal screen resolution and sets it automatically, but this does not always happen when you set up a guest OS in a VM. The cause may be related to hardware, the host OS or video drivers, the guest OS, the VM's video driver, or a configuration error that you cannot find. 

### Solution

Find out the maximum framebuffer size supported on the host system (not the VM):

```shell
xrandr | grep maximum
```

On the guest OS (running in the VM), create a mode for the resolution and refresh rate you want. I typically make this a little smaller than the resolution I'm using on the host OS, so it will fit within the VM window with no scrolling necessary. This command will generate a mode line:

```shell
gtf 1440 900 59.9
```

Now create a mode using the result produced by gtf, add it to the table, and set the screen resolution. 

- The identifier for VirtualBox is VBOX0
- The identifier for VMware is Virtual1

```shell
xrandr --newmode "1440x900_59.90"  106.29  1440 1520 1672 1904  900 901 904 932  -HSync +Vsync
xrandr --addmode VBOX0 1440x900_59.90
xrandr --output VBOX0 --mode 1440x900_59.90
```

To make the setting persistent, create the file ```/etc/X11/xorg.conf``` and edit it to correspond with the desired video settings:

```shell
sudo Xorg -configure :1
sudo cp /root/xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf
```

Edit ```/etc/X11/xorg.conf``` with root privileges.

Restart Xorg service. Procedure differs by OS and distro; see references or Google it.

## yum

### Yum lock is held

```shell
Another app is currently holding the yum lock; waiting for it to exit...
The other application is: yum
```

This means an instance of yum is hanging around in the background. You can't do anything with it.

### Solution

```shell
sudo killall yum
sudo rm /var/run/yum.pid
```
